# Notes for the GRE Exam

## 1. Analytical Writing Section

### 1.1 Analyze an Issue

You are given an issue and you discuss it (usually) by being in favor or against it.

[YouTube Video 1][1]

Usually you can argue for one side or another but you should most certainly not argue for both.

Tips

1. Write at least 3 practice essays

2. Don't hesitate to choose a side. You don't have the time.

3. Choose very specific real world examples. Some reasonable and realistic. Hypothetical things can be easily argued against.

4. Make sure your examples are relevant. Don't think that you always need examples everywhere.

5. Avoid first person and self reference. In general this is true. Talk in general, personal opinion usually does not result in a strong argument. Caveats: some examples are from your personal life, it can be appropriate to talk about yourself here in order not to sound awkward with second/third person.

6. Make strong declarative statements, be direct and to the point. Make your ideas as clear as possible. Think as your grader as a computer, be clear enough so that a computer could potentially understand you.

7. Acknowledge the opposing view of your argument and once you identify the main points of this arguments refute them with yours.

#### 1.1.3 Conclusion

#### 1.2.1 <a name="graders" href="javascript:;">What are graders looking for?</a>

1. That you respond to the specific instructions of the prompt.

2. That you understand the complexities of the argument (or issue for the other essay).

3. That you know how to organize your essay into paragraphs.

4. That you know how to use evidence and examples to support your position.

5. That you can avoid grammatical tragedies.

Recommended structure in video:

#### 1.2.2 Introduction Paragraph

"I understand what the argument is saying" by acknowledging the main points and assumptions.

"Hey the author **concludes** this, the author uses this as **evidence**, however the author makes several important assumptions that need to be considered before one is to accept or reject the argument". Thesis: "The key points a, lacks a.1, the keypoint b, lacks b.1, ..."

#### 1.2.3 Body paragraphs

- One for each assumption in the thesis
- The three **Fs**
- Support each contradiction to the assumptions with examples and evidence. Develop ideas and thought

"**First**, the author assumes that ..., if that assumption is false ..., **furthermore** ...., **finally**

#### 1.2.4 Conclusion

Don't look like you know everything and remind the graders that you know what the task is.

"Look, I can see why the author thinks this argument is valid since ..., BUT ..."

## 2. Verbal Reasoning

Consists of two sections, each with 20 questions and 30 minutes. This means that, on average, you should spend 1 minute and 30 seconds per question.

## 3. Quantitative Reasoning

Consists of two sections, each one with with 20 questions and 35 minutes. This means that, on average, you should spend 1.75 minutes/questions = 1 minute and 45 seconds.

## 4. Unscored or Research Section

An additional quantitative or verbal section. This section does not count towards the final score. Test takers do not know which is the experimental section so they need to put equal effort in all sections. This section is used to test questions for future GREs.
